### Requirement:
- To setup a WordPress website using docker-compose.yml and docker-compose

### Strategy:
- Docker uses a docker-compose.yml to define the orchestration.
- "docker-compose" is an orchestration tool which uses the docker-compose.yml to setup multiple containers.
- For above requirement we need the following:
  - WordPress is a multi tier application with a front-end, business layer and a database back-end.
  - One of the features of docker is single responsibility principle. So these multiple layers will be represented by multiple images and containers
  - Install docker-compose and setup the file docker-compose.yml
 
### Solution:
- Login to your Host machine(in my case a CentOS 7 machine)
- Make a directory “TicTackToe” and go to the directory – 
  ```
  mkdir mywordpress && cd mywordpress
  ```
- Now setup and define images and configuration in the docker-compose.yml- 
  ```
  nano dockercompose.yml
  ```
- Copy following content into the file and save:
  ```
  version: '3.3'
  services:
     db:
       image: mysql:5.7
       volumes:
         - dbdata:/var/lib/mysql
       restart: always
       environment:
         MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: somewordpress
         MYSQL_DATABASE: wordpress
         MYSQL_USER: wordpress
         MYSQL_PASSWORD: wordpress
     wordpress:
       depends_on:
         - db
       image: wordpress:latest
       ports:
         - "8000:80"
       restart: always
       environment:
         WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db:3306
         WORDPRESS_DB_USER: wordpress
         WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: wordpress
  volumes:
      dbdata:
  networks:
      overlay:
  ```
- OR Download the code:
  - Download the docker-compose.yml from here – [https://testbucket786786.s3.amazonaws.com/docker/docker-compose.yml](https://testbucket786786.s3.amazonaws.com/docker/docker-compose.yml)
- "docker-compose" uses some terms to define the configuration
  - ##services: it user service keyword to define services
  - the file defines two services
    - **db** for database image settings: **image: mysql:5.7**
    - **volume** for database volumes : **/var/lib/mysql**
    - a setting - **restart: always**
    - and then environment settings like database, username, password and root password.
    - **wordpress** for wordpress settings
    - **depends on db** means that wordpress service is dependent db service to be ready first
    - **image: wordpress:latest**
    - **ports: “8000:80”** means 8000 is host port “port forwarding” to port 80 of container and then environment settings like host, user, password
    - **volumes**: it user columes keyword to define volumes to be used and attached in the configuration networks
- **Install docker-compose tool**
  - execute these commands:
    ```
    sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.20.1/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/bin
    ```
- Check if focker compose is installed 
  ```
  docker-compose -version
  ```
- Build using docker-compose 
  ```
  docker-compose up -d 
  ```
- Lets access the website:
  - Yay!!!, WordPress is up.
  - Run it now
    - Use DNS name if your DNS is set like mine: [http://mnaeemsiddiqui5.mylabserver.com:8000](http://mnaeemsiddiqui5.mylabserver.com:8000)
    - You can either use your DNS name like : [http://yourDNSwebsite:8000](http://yourDNSwebsite:8000)
    - or if you are using localhost then - [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
