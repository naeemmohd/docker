### Requirement:
- To run a Tic Tack Toe  which is written in Python

### Strategy:
- Docker uses a Dockerfile to define what all will be going in a container
- For above requirement we need the following:
  - a Python runtime
  - a working directory with the Python file
  - a command to execute the Python file
  - build the app
  - push the container to Docker Hub( you will need to create Docker Hub account and a repository under the account, Please visit hub.docker.com)
  - pull the image 
  - run the container

### Solution:
- Login to your Host machine(in my case a CentOS 7 machine)
- Make a directory "TicTackToe" and go to the directory - 
  ```
  mkdir TicTackToe && cd TicTackToe
  ```
- Download my Python Tic Tack Toe game from here - 
  ```
  wget https://testbucket786786.s3.amazonaws.com/python/TictacToe.py
  ```
- Now create a Dockerfile - 
   ```
   nano ~/Dockerfile
   ```
- Copy the below contents into the Dockerfile and save-    
   ```
   # Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
   FROM python:2.7-slim

   # Set the working directory to /app
   WORKDIR /app

   # Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
   ADD . /app

   # Run TicTacToe.py when the container launches
   CMD ["python", "TictacToe.py"]
   ```
- Now build the app(naeemstictactoelatest  is the image name you want for this app)- 
  ```
  docker build -t naeemstictactoelatest .
  ```
- Now check for the image name for your app
  ```
  docker images
  ```
- Now login to Docker Hub ( On DockerHUb - hub.docker.com - you need to create an account and a repository, mnaeemsiddiqui is user and naeemsrepo is repository)
  ```
  docker tag naeemstictactoelatest mnaeemsiddiqui/naeemsrepo:naeemstictactoelatest
  ```
- Now tag it for pushing it to Docker Hub
  ```
  docker tag naeemstictactoelatest mnaeemsiddiqui/naeemsrepo:naeemstictactoelatest
  ```
- Now push the image Docker Hub
  ```
  docker push mnaeemsiddiqui/naeemsrepo:naeemstictactoelatest
  ```
- Now pull the image from Docker Hub
  ```
  docker pull mnaeemsiddiqui/naeemsrepo:naeemstictactoelatest
  ```
- Now run the container/app
  ```
  docker run -it mnaeemsiddiqui/naeemsrepo:naeemstictactoelatest
  ```
